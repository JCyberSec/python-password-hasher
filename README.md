# python-password-hasher

This is a very basic code to import a file, which contains a number of hashes. It then uses a word dictionary to hash the new words and compare the hashes. Once it finds a match, it prints the password to console.

It is messy, however I don't have time to make it perfect and refine it, sorry.
